# Infoblox DNS Controller

Manage Host records in Infoblox DNS through Kubernetes Ingresses

## Description

Infoblox DNS controller allows for automated DNS management using the native Kubernete Ingress resource. The controller reconciles host records in Infoblox DNS using host rules in Ingresses. The IPv4 address used in the Host record is whatever IP provided in the Ingress status field.

## Getting Started

Youâ€™ll need a Kubernetes cluster to run against. You can use [KIND](https://sigs.k8s.io/kind) to get a local cluster for testing, or run against a remote cluster.
**Note:** Your controller will automatically use the current context in your kubeconfig file (i.e. whatever cluster `kubectl cluster-info` shows).

### Running on the cluster

1. Install the controller using the provided kustomizations

```sh
kubectl apply -k config/default
```

2. Create a Secret containing credentials to Infoblox DNS

```sh
kubectl create secret generic infoblox-server-credentials \
    --from-literal INFOBLOX_USERNAME=<username> \
    --from-literal INFOBLOX_PASSWORD=<password> \
    --from-literal INFOBLOX_SERVER=<server> \
    --from-literal INFOBLOX_VIEW=<netview> \
    --from-literal INFOBLOX_ZONE=<dnsview>
```

3. Annotate your Ingress to have it managed by the controller

```
kubectl annotate ingress <your ingress> infoblox-dns-controller/manage=true
```
